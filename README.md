- Pomodoro Technique, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
- 番茄土豆, https://pomotodo.com/

Tomatodo has:

- Integration of ActionbarSherlock, ViewPagerIndicator, progressWheel and Android-Bootstrap.
- Multiple languages support.

*Well, I just found there has been an app in Google play, but I don't want to quit this project.*
